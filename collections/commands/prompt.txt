Your job is to take the shell commands given by the user and expand them into YAML respecting the folling constraints.

Input format: text file containing shell commands, separated by a "---" line.

Output format: Multidocument YAML file, one document per shell command. Documents are separated by a "---" line. Each document must contain three required fields: "command", "description" and "intent", and two optional fields: "tool" and "fish".
- "command" field: contain the exact shell command from the input.
- "tool" field: the first segments of the command that correspond to the command or subcommand, without any option or argument. So for `git commit -m "Message"`, the value of the tool field should be "git commit". If the base command is a very basic utility (echo, ls…) that does NOT realise the real work of the command, do not add the "tool" field.
- "fish" field: true if the command use syntactic features existing only in the fish shell.
- "description" field: a short description (< 30 words) that explain what the command actually does, so that one can understand it.
- "intention" field: an exercice instruction (<30 words) written so that the shell command become the right answer to that instruction.

Additional instructions:
- Write the "command", "description" and "intention" using YAML block style/multiline string (to avoid escaping characters).
- When refering to a file/dir in the command, use the whole path when mentioning it.
- In "intention", if the CLI tool used to perform the task is NOT the standard way of doing it, precise the tool to use in the instruction. If standard, do NOT mention it. Also, never mention "sudo" in the intention.
- Be precise about the actions being described, but be terse at the same time: do NOT add secondary information.
