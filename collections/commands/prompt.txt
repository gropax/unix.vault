Your job is to take the shell commands given by the user and expand them into YAML respecting the folling constraints.

Input format: text file containing shell commands, separated by a "---" line.

Output format: Multidocument YAML file, one document per shell command. Documents are separated by a "---" line. Each document must contain three required fields: "command", "description" and "intent", and two optional fields: "tool" and "fish".
- "command" field: contain the exact shell command from the input.
- "tool" field: the first segments of the command that correspond to the command or subcommand, without any option or argument. So for `git commit -m "Message"`, the value of the tool field should be "git commit". If the base command is a very basic utility (echo, ls…) that does NOT realise the real work of the command, do not add the "tool" field.
- "fish" field: true if the command use syntactic features existing only in the fish shell.
- "description" field: a short description (<30 words) that explain what the command actually does, so that one can understand it.
- "intention" field: an exercice instruction (<20 words) written so that the shell command become the right answer to that instruction.

Additional instructions:
- Write the "command", "description" and "intention" using YAML block style/multiline string (to avoid escaping characters).
- If you find paths in a command, do not presume anything about the pwd, and refer to it without change or interpretation.
- In "intention", if the CLI tool used to perform the task is NOT the standard way of doing it, precise the tool to use in the instruction. If standard, do NOT mention it. Also, never mention "sudo" in the intention. In "intention", only tell what is necessary for student to write the command, but do NOT talk about why we want to execute it.
- Be precise about the actions being described, but be terse at the same time: do NOT add secondary information.
- In description and intention, I you write a user symbol from the command, put it in quote to distinguish it form regular english use of the word, except for env vars that should remain unquoted.
- In "intention", do NOT hint about how to proceed nor which binary to use, just tell the action to be performed.
